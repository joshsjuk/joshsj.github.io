      <p>
        <span id="greeting">Hello</span>! I'm a second-year Software Engineering
        student, passionate about full-stack and desktop development currently
        seeking a third-year placement.
      </p>

      <p>
        My top project from university is an events ticketing site. Currently in
        development, it requires a responsive front-end with SEO and
        accessibility features, PHP and MySQL back-end to serve dynamic content,
        and an authenticated CMS to manage ticket information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another ongoing project is a concurrent meeting scheduler, which
        balances constraints like availability, preferred times/locations, room
        requirements, attendee priority, with real-world viability. Resolving
        conflicts uses client-defined policies, and meetings are dynamically
        rescheduled in response to constraint changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of university, I'm expanding my back-end skills using Node.js to
        develop 'lookbook' &mdash; a lightweight mood-board site for clothing,
        much like Pinterest.
        <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> provides the web framework
        and <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb">nedb</a> manages the
        database.
